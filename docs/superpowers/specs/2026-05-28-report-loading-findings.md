# Report Loading Findings — 2026-05-28

Captured via the profiling tooling built per [2026-05-28-report-loading-profiling-design.md](2026-05-28-report-loading-profiling-design.md).

## Run metadata

- Environment: local prod build (`next build && next start`)
- Date range used: `last_30_days`
- Walker: sequential, all clients × all `enabledReports`
- Total PERF entries captured: 102
- Caveat: local-network latency to vendor APIs differs from Vercel-network latency. Numbers are **relative signal**, not production SLO.

## Raw analyzer output

```

(Table 2 omitted — see "Tooling caveat" below; the section-boundary heuristic produced too many spurious 1-fetch sections to be useful in this run.)

## Top offenders

1. **`ga4/runReport` — biggest aggregate spend.** 33 calls totaling 16.82s, median 364ms, p95 1.49s, max 2.02s. This is the GA4 19-call fan-out per render the design predicted. The slowest single GA4 call sets the floor for every GA4-driven report.
2. **`hubspot/getContactStats` — single-call outlier at 3.13s.** Largest single observation in the whole run. Worth opening up to see whether it's a quota/throttling issue, a large date range, or a slow endpoint.
3. **`hubspot/getPipelineDeals` at ~1.03s median (2 calls).** Paginated deal search across pipeline `714699412`; pagination is sequential which compounds.
4. **`db/getClientByEmail` at 720ms median (n=2, suggestive only).** This is on the **auth path** — runs on every authenticated request. Neon serverless shouldn't be this slow; likely cold-connection warm-up on the first walker request, or a missed index. n=2 means median ≈ mean of two samples, so the headline number is suggestive rather than characterized. Worth a targeted re-measurement before acting.
5. **HubSpot performance section appears to be effectively sequential** — one section showing 9 fetches, 4.66s wall, sum 4.66s, parallelism 1.0x. The calls should be parallelized via `Promise.all`.

## Things that are NOT a problem

- **GA4 parallelism is working.** The biggest GA4 section shows 14 fetches, 2.02s wall, sum 9.22s — that's 4.6x parallelism, meaning the `Promise.all` is doing its job. The remaining slowness is the slowest single call, not lost parallelism.
- **`db/getClientBySlug` is fast.** 44 calls, median 0ms (cache hits dominating), max 170ms. The `React.cache()` dedup is working well per render.

## Anomalies worth flagging

- **`peec/getOverview` errored (err=1) and only ran once.** Pre-existing issue per `TODO.md`? Single-call sample so can't characterize timing.
- **`db/getClientByEmail` 720ms median** is much higher than expected for a Neon serverless query. Could be auth-path cold start. Worth a targeted check.

## Tooling caveat — Table 2 section grouping

The `perSection` heuristic in `scripts/perf-report.ts` infers section boundaries from `db/getClientBySlug` calls. In practice `getClientBySlug` is `React.cache()`-wrapped, so it logs ~0ms after first call per render and the grouping breaks down into many spurious 1-fetch "sections." The meaningful aggregations are still readable in Tables 1 and 3.

If we want clean per-section numbers in the next iteration, we'd need to promote to the Option B design (section-level wraps with `AsyncLocalStorage` request IDs). For now Tables 1 + 3 give us the actionable signal.

## Recommended next actions

Frame each as a candidate brainstorm — implementation work is **not** part of this profiling pass.

1. **HubSpot performance section parallelization brainstorm.** The 9-call, 1x-parallelism section is the easiest win — likely a `for...await` pattern in `components/report-sections/hubspot-performance/index.tsx` that should become a `Promise.all`. Likely a single-PR fix.

2. **HubSpot `getContactStats` deep-dive.** Why 3.13s? Read the implementation, check the date range, see if there's a smaller version of the same query that satisfies callers.

3. **DB `getClientByEmail` auth-path investigation.** Confirm whether the 720ms median is real or a measurement artifact (cold connection on first walker request). If real, options include: warm the connection in middleware, denormalize the email→role lookup into a smaller table, or cache the JWT-baked role longer.

4. **GA4 — the larger conversation.** With 16.82s aggregate spend and an already-parallelized fan-out, the remaining lever is **fewer calls** or **faster calls**. Two paths from TODO.md:
   - Per-vendor caching layer (cheaper, smaller change).
   - The BigQuery consolidation (much bigger change, much bigger win — Supermetrics already populates some GA4 tables there for FFCI).

5. **(Optional) Tooling iteration.** If the next session wants clean per-section numbers, promote to the Option B design from the spec — section-level wraps with `AsyncLocalStorage` request IDs.

## Caching results (2026-05-29 — perf/report-loading-fixes branch)

After the vendor-layer caching design from [2026-05-28-vendor-caching-design.md](2026-05-28-vendor-caching-design.md) was implemented per [the plan](../plans/2026-05-28-vendor-caching.md).

### Methodology

- Same local prod build (`next build && PERF_LOG=1 next start`), single walker pass-pair.
- Walker (`scripts/perf-walk.ts --pass cold|warm`) hits `/api/perf/boundary?label=<pass>` before walking, so `perf-compare.ts` splits cold/warm deterministically.
- Session cookie was minted directly via `@auth/core/jwt.encode()` against `AUTH_SECRET` instead of browser sign-in (deviation from plan Step 2 — the result is functionally identical).
- Walker iterated 2 clients × `enabledReports` = 8 URLs per pass.

### Bug fixed mid-verification

The boundary route lived at `app/api/_perf/boundary/` from commit f630b46. App Router treats folders prefixed with `_` as private (excluded from routing), so the boundary URL 404'd despite `PERF_LOG=1`. Renamed to `app/api/perf/boundary/` and updated the two references in `scripts/perf-walk.ts`. The `PERF_LOG=1` gate inside the route still provides the "only exists when profiling is on" guarantee.

### Results

```
Parsed 45 cold + 31 warm entries from perf-cache.log

vendor          cold_wait   warm_wait   delta     hit_rate
ga4             13.48s      26ms        -100%     100%
hubspot         1.38s       1ms         -100%     100%
db              1.08s       1.06s       -2%       0%
```

### Observations

- **GA4 caching works perfectly.** 13.48s cold → 26ms warm (-100%, 100% hit rate). This is the headline win — GA4 was the biggest aggregate spend in the original profiling.
- **HubSpot caching works perfectly.** 1.38s cold → 1ms warm (-100%, 100% hit rate). But this was only 2 calls (`getOwnerMap`, `getPipelineDeals`) — see coverage gap below.
- **`db` 0% hit rate is expected.** `getClientBySlug` / `getAllClients` are wrapped with `React.cache()` (per-render dedup) only, not `cached()` (cross-render). Plan acknowledged leaving inner React cache alone. -2% delta is noise.
- **Cross-client smoke: PARTIAL.** The walker hit both `avenue-z` and `renaissance` portal URLs without errors, and the GA4 cold calls in the log are correctly tagged with `client:"avenue-z"`. No cross-client contamination observed in the surfaces that actually rendered. Full visual smoke wasn't performed.

### Coverage gap — verification under-exercises the cache surface

The portal route's `getReportSection` switch in [app/portal/[clientSlug]/reports/[reportSlug]/page.tsx:36](../../../app/portal/[clientSlug]/reports/[reportSlug]/page.tsx#L36) is missing cases for `demand-overview`, `peec-ai`, `inbound-funnel`, and `request-a-report` — those slugs are in `enabledReports`, the components exist, but the route falls through to `default: return null`. So those URLs returned 200 with an empty shell and never invoked their fetchers.

The dashboard route ([app/dashboard/[clientSlug]/reports/page.tsx](../../../app/dashboard/[clientSlug]/reports/page.tsx)) wires those report sections correctly. The walker only hits portal URLs, so:

- `peec`, `bigquery`, `profound`, and 16 of 18 HubSpot fetchers were never invoked during the cold/warm walk.
- The 8/8 ok / 4.1s cold elapsed reflects mostly empty shells (~60ms each) plus the two pages that do render (`/ga4` and `/hubspot-performance`).

The caching layer is verified for the surfaces that did exercise it. The rest is unverified by this run, not broken.

### Outstanding items

1. ~~**Portal report route is missing 4 cases.**~~ Done in this branch — `demand-overview`, `peec-ai`, `inbound-funnel`, `request-a-report` now wired into the portal switch (base cases; subsections still dashboard-only).
2. ~~**Re-run cold/warm after the route gap is closed.**~~ Done — see Round 2 below.
3. ~~**Walker should optionally cover dashboard routes too.**~~ Done — `scripts/perf-walk.ts` now accepts `--surface portal|dashboard|both`.
4. **HTTP response times reported by the walker are not wall-clock data wait.** Streaming RSC + Suspense closes the initial chunk fast (~60-200ms) while cached fetches continue. The PERF log between boundaries is the correct measurement surface; the walker's per-URL ms column is informational only.

## Caching results — Round 2 (2026-05-29 — extended coverage)

Re-run after closing the portal route coverage gap and adding `--surface both` to the walker. Same prod build, same methodology as Round 1.

### Methodology

- `npx tsx scripts/perf-walk.ts --pass cold --surface both` then `--pass warm --surface both`.
- 16 URLs per pass (2 clients × 6 portal + 8 dashboard reports — note enabledReports lists vary by client).

### Results

```
Parsed 112 cold + 102 warm entries from perf-cache.log

vendor          cold_wait   warm_wait   delta     hit_rate
peec            13.79s      28ms        -100%     100%
profound        9.19s       22ms        -100%     100%
hubspot         7.32s       4ms         -100%     100%
ga4             7.09s       62ms        -99%      100%
db              3.63s       1.72s       -52%      0%
```

### Observations

- **All four `cached()`-wrapped vendors hit 100% hit rate with -99% or -100% delta.** Peec, profound, and hubspot were not exercised at all in Round 1 — they are now and they behave the same as ga4. The `cached()` pattern is uniform across vendors.
- **Peec was the biggest single hidden win.** 13.79s cold spend → 28ms warm. Round 1 missed this entirely.
- **`db` shows -52% delta but still 0% hit rate.** Expected — React.cache only. The improvement is connection warm-up (cold pass first hit pays the Neon serverless cold start), not caching.
- **BigQuery still not exercised** — only `components/report-sections/conversational-summary` imports it, and that section isn't in any client's `enabledReports`. Out of scope for this walker until a client enables it.
- **Cross-client smoke (round 2).** Both clients walked clean on both surfaces, no errors. PERF log shows correct `client:` tags on per-client fetches. No cross-client contamination observed.

### What's left

- Portal subsections for `peec-ai` (pr-influence, content-impact, technical-audit), `inbound-funnel` (forms, pacing), and `ga4` (conversion-journey, search-console) are still dashboard-only. They use the same `cached()` fetchers under the hood, so caching should behave identically — but it's untested at the portal surface. Decide whether portal should expose them or stay scoped. (Update: dashboard subsection walking added in Round 3 — see below.)
- BigQuery's `conversational-summary` section has wraps but no walker coverage; if it ever becomes an enabled report, re-run.

## Caching results — Round 3 (2026-05-29 — subsection coverage)

Re-run after extending the walker with a `SUBSECTIONS` map so `peec-ai/pr-influence`, `peec-ai/content-impact`, and `peec-ai/technical-audit` get hit on the dashboard surface. These subsections call additional cached fetchers (`getAgentAnalytics` notably) that Round 2 missed entirely.

### Methodology

- Same prod build, same walker.
- 22 URLs per pass (16 from Round 2 + 6 new subsection URLs across 2 clients).
- **Caveat: Round 3 "cold" is partially warm.** Next.js's `unstable_cache` data cache persists in `.next/cache/` across `next start` restarts. We didn't `rm -rf .next/cache` between Round 2 and Round 3, so vendors that were already cached in Round 2 (ga4, hubspot, peec, profound) have small cold totals here. The genuinely-new subsection vendors (`getAgentAnalytics`, sitebulb, screaming-frog, content-calendar, pr-proof) are truly cold because nothing in Round 2 invoked them.

### Results

```
Parsed 154 cold + 144 warm entries from perf-cache.log

hubspot         11ms        4ms         -64%      100%
```

### Observations

- **`peec/getAgentAnalytics` is verified.** 2 true cold calls (224ms, 668ms) → all subsequent calls `cached:true` at 0–3ms. This was the headline gap Round 3 was designed to close.
- **3 new clean wins surfaced via subsections.** `sitebulb` (3.46s → 0ms), `screaming-frog` (2.21s → 0ms), `content-calendar` (1.09s → 5ms successful-path) — all show the same -100%/100% pattern.
- **`pr-proof` is broken at the fetcher level, not the cache layer.** All 4 calls returned `ok:false` (errors). `cached()` correctly does NOT cache failed results, so each subsequent call retries and re-errors → 0% hit rate. This is a real bug in pr-proof itself, surfaced by Wave 3 but unrelated to caching. Worth a separate brainstorm.
- **`content-calendar` half-failed.** 2 calls succeeded (and one cached cleanly), 2 returned `ok:false`. Same shape as pr-proof's issue but partial. Worth investigating which calls fail and why.
- **GA4 hit_rate at 93% (one miss in warm).** One ga4Query variant in a subsection presumably used a dynamic date that didn't match its cold counterpart. Below threshold but not a cache regression — investigate the specific call key if it matters.
- **Existing-vendor cold totals are not Round-2-comparable.** Carrying over from the caveat above — ga4 2.52s / hubspot 11ms here vs Round 2's 7.09s / 7.32s is the persistent data cache, not a regression. The hit-rate numbers are still meaningful.

### Outstanding bugs surfaced by Round 3

1. **`pr-proof/getData` returns errors for all walked clients/subsections.** Investigate the fetcher.
2. **`content-calendar/getData` has 50% error rate.** Half the calls succeed, half don't.

These are independent of caching but are the kind of thing a verification walk is supposed to surface.

## Caching results — Round 4 (2026-05-29 — wall-clock user-perceived)

Rounds 1-3 measured aggregate vendor-side wait via PERF logs. That's directionally honest but the magnitude overstates user impact because parallel fetches mean a real user waits for the slowest branch, not the sum.

Round 4 introduces `scripts/perf-wallclock.ts` — a walker that times each URL from `fetch()` start to **full body drain**, which is the closest approximation to "data is on the user's screen." Ran against a fresh `.next/cache` to get truly cold numbers.

### Methodology

- `rm -rf .next/cache` before `PERF_LOG=1 npm run start`
- `tsx scripts/perf-wallclock.ts --passes 2 --surface both`
- Pass 1 = cold (cache empty), Pass 2 = warm (populated by pass 1)
- Note: the walker hits portal URLs first, so dashboard URLs share the portal pass's cache warmth on the cold pass — except for subsection-only fetchers (`getAgentAnalytics`), which portal doesn't exercise.

### Results — portal pages (true cold)

dashboard/renaissance/peec-ai/pr-influence      278ms   308ms    +11%   (noise — single sample)
```

### Aggregate

**38.8s total cold → 2.3s total warm across all 22 URLs = -94%.**

### Observations

- **The biggest user-facing wins are on the slowest pages.** `demand-overview` and `peec-ai` at portal are 5-10 seconds cold and ~100ms warm. That's a 100-150× speedup for the second user.
- **First-user cost is real.** Caching doesn't help the very first visit after a deploy or cache eviction. `demand-overview` at 10s cold is a UX problem for whoever lands first. The relevant follow-up brainstorm is whether to pre-warm critical caches at deploy time or via cron.
- **Even cold, ga4 (1.7s) and hubspot-performance (276ms) are tolerable.** The aggregate fetcher-wait numbers from Rounds 1-3 made it look like ga4 was 13s+; in practice the parallel fan-out keeps the user wait under 2s on cold.
- **Wall-clock delta (94%) closely matches the per-fetcher delta** (99-100%) for the slow pages. The discrepancy is on pages already fast cold (hubspot-performance, request-a-report) where shell-render + db overhead dominates and caching has less room to help.

### What the prior rounds got wrong

Rounds 1-3 reported things like "ga4 13.48s → 26ms". That number is the sum of every individual GA4 fetch logged during the walk — across 16 walked URLs, multiple Suspense boundaries per page, parallel branches. No single user ever waited 13.48s. They waited ~1.7s (slowest single ga4 query branch on the slowest page) on cold, and ~64ms on warm.

The aggregate numbers were not wrong — they're an honest measure of cumulative server work eliminated — but they answer a different question than "how long does the user wait?" Round 4 answers that question.
